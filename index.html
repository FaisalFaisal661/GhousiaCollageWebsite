                    The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics,
                    dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to
                    these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD),
                    computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and Etc.
